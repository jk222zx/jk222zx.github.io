        <p>Honesty lasts longest.
            This site is, at least so far, made as a part of an examination for a
            university course in programming.
            Perhaps it will used for something else later.</p>
        <p>Update: 2016-06-06</p>
        <p>A first attempt to use this site to "publish" results from other courses has been made.</p>
