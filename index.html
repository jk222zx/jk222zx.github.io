    <h4>A remark about language used on this site.</h4>
    <p class="fontsize15">Unfortunately the language used on this site will be english and swedish mixed. It seems the software used to
    write this webb-page doesn't like the extra swedish vowels that is not in the english alphabet. In the blog-posts
    however there seems to be no problem at all so swedish will be used there.</p>
